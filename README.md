# Water Quality ML Project

This repository contains code and structure for analysing water quality data in the context of climate change using machine learning.

## Structure
src/
  preprocess.py       # Preprocessing, reshaping, and feature engineering
data/
  raw/                # Local raw CSV (too large to upload)
  processed/          # Cleaned, imputed data outputs
reports/
  figures/            # Visualisations and graphs
## Team Roles
- **Kosi:** Data preprocessing, parameter selection, and data quality analysis.
- **Noor:** Exploratory visualisation and statistical analysis.
- **Lucy:** MLR model building and interpretation.
- **John:** Code quality assurance, debugging and optimisation of scripts.

## Instructions
1. Place `water-quality-1.csv` in the `data/raw/` folder (not included in repo).
2. Run `preprocess.py` to prepare the data.
3. Output will be saved to `data/processed/`.

## Notes
Raw data is excluded for size and privacy reasons. Placeholders remain in the repo to indicate file structure.
